      "summary": "An animated paper umbrella yokai, a type of tsukumogami (tool that gained sentience after 100 years). Characterized by a single eye, long tongue, and hopping on one leg (its handle), kasa-obake are friendly, comical yokai that surprise people with harmless pranks.",
      "full": "Kasa-obake (傘お化け, 'umbrella ghost'), also known as karakasa-kozo, is a type of Japanese yokai classified as tsukumogami—objects that have gained sentience and spirit after being neglected or abandoned for 100 years. Specifically, kasa-obake are old paper umbrellas (karakasa) that have come to life. The typical appearance features a single large eye, a long tongue hanging out, and one or two legs (actually the umbrella's handle) on which it hops around. Unlike many yokai, kasa-obake are not threatening or malevolent; they are playful, comical creatures that delight in surprising unsuspecting people but cause no real harm. Their antics typically involve hopping around streets at night, startling passersby with their unusual appearance. Kasa-obake embody the traditional Japanese philosophy of mottainai (avoiding waste) and the Shinto belief that all objects, especially those used for many years, can develop spirits (kami). They serve as reminders to treat possessions with respect and gratitude. In modern times, kasa-obake have become one of the most recognizable and beloved yokai, frequently appearing in cute, friendly forms in anime, manga, and merchandise."
