## Overview

Kasa-obake (傘お化け, "umbrella ghost"), also known as karakasa-kozo, is one of the most recognizable and beloved yokai in Japanese folklore. A type of **tsukumogami**—objects that gain sentience after 100 years of service—kasa-obake are old paper umbrellas that have come to life after being neglected or abandoned.

These charming yokai are instantly recognizable: a single large eye in the center of the umbrella canopy, a long tongue hanging out playfully, and hopping around on one leg (the umbrella's handle, often wearing a traditional wooden sandal). Unlike many yokai, kasa-obake are **completely harmless**—they are playful, comical creatures who enjoy surprising people but mean no actual harm.

Kasa-obake embody important Japanese cultural values: **mottainai** (the regret of wastefulness), gratitude for objects that serve us, and the Shinto belief that all things, even everyday tools, can develop spiritual presence.
